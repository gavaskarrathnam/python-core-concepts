# exercises

'''
1) Ask the user to enter their given name and surname in response to a single prompt.
Use split to extract the names, and then assign each name to a different variable.
For this exercise, you can assume that the user has a single given name and a single surname.
'''
# name = input("Please enter your full name:")
# name = name.split(" ")
# print(f"First name: {name[0].strip().title()}")
# print(f"last name: {name[1].strip().title()}")


'''
2) Print the list, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], in the format 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 using the join method. 
Remember that you can only join collections of strings, so youâ€™re going to need to do some initial processing of the list of numbers.
'''
number = "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5"
number_list = number.split(" | ")
cleansed_no_list = []
for no in number_list:
    cleansed_no_list.append(int(no.strip()))

print(cleansed_no_list)
